      <h2 id="DNT">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
        Do-Not-Track ( &#39;DNT&#39; ) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
        preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
        At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalised . As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
        other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
        standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
        you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

        such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
